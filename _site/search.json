    "text": "About this website and me…\nHello, and welcome to my website. This site is meant to be repository of my academic research, the open-source tools that I’ve developed to facilitate various analyses, and tutorials that others might find useful. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.\nI am a climate change ecologist and an expert in understanding how plants are responding to climate change. I’m fascinated with plant physiology, biogeography, and how these subjects can be used to develop nature-based climate solutions that will be resilient to climate change.\nI have a BSc in plant biology from the University of Vermont, a PhD in biology from the University of Miami, and held the prestigious Killam Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of British Columbia. My academic research focuses on how climate change interacts with plant physiology to influence growth, carbon sequestration and species distributions. From 2017-2023 I helped author 16 peer-reviewed scientific publications on climate change and plant ecology in leading journals including Science, PNAS, and Nature Climate Change.\nWhile I love academic research, I joined the private sector in 2022 in order to have a more direct impact on mitigating climate change. Since doing so, I have developed analytical pipelines and carbon reporting tools as part of a team at Conservation International investigating how to scale natural climate solutions. I am currently the Lead Carbon Scientist at Living Carbon where I am part of a team developing nature-based climate change mitigation projects with the first trees ever engineered to enhance photosynthesis and increase carbon sequestration."

    "text": "This first blog post is mostly intended as a test… but as long as I’m here, I might as well explain why it’s called “422”. This name is relatively arbitrary, I came up with it about 10 minutes ago, and it’s probably taking me longer to write this post than it did to come up with the name. However, this name is probably more symbolic than I intended. 422 signifies the average CO~2~ concentration recorded over the course of the day at the the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii on January 20, 2024 - and is the most recent recording relative to the creation of this post. The Mauna Loa Observatory is the perhaps the original bellwether of climate change, and since this blog will track my trajectory through climate change science, industry, and data analysis, the name “422” seems apt.\nIn case you were wondering, no, the image above is not from Hawaii. it is from the top of Mt Steele in British Columbia on the Sunshine Coast looking northwest across the Salish Sea to Vancouver Island in July, 2022."

    "text": "Research (under construction)\nMy research interests can be categorized into three main areas that are described below.\n\nClimate Change\nAnthropogenic climate change is a complex process that is partially characterized by increasing climatic temperatures and increasing climatic variability. Furthermore, climate change is occurring at a pace that is unprecedented in Earth’s history. The short-term and long-term consequences of climate change on plants are unclear. I’m interested in understanding how climate change will influence the physiological functions of plants and these functions translate to broader patterns in plant ecology.\n\n\nEcophysiology\nEcophysiology is the study of the interrelationship between physiological processes the environment. Plant ecophysiology is a broad discipline, and my research interests currently focus on understanding how plants respond to and cope with variation in temperature. More specifically, I am interested in understanding how temperatures influence photosynthesis.\nPhotosynthesis is an essential metabolic process for most plants, and is important for everything from predicting plant growth, survival, and reproduction to ecosystem services like carbon sequestration. Understanding the effects of temperature on photosynthesis is fundamental for understanding broader patterns in ecology and evolution including predicting how plants will respond to climate change.\n\n\nBiogeography\nBiogeography is the study of the geographic and temporal distributions of life. Biogeographic information can help us understand species’ adaptations and their evolutionary histories. In recent years, a wealth of plant biogeographic data - largely from digitized herbarium specimens - has become publicly available. Coupled with macro- and microclimate data, this biogeographic data has been particularly valuable for understanding how plants are shifting their distributions in response to climate change.\nAs plants shift their distributions, plant communities can become altered. These alterations may include changes in community diversity and to ecosystem services like carbon storage. A goal of my research is to understand patterns in plant biogeography in order to predict about how climate change will alter plant communities and inform conservation decisions."
