ðŸŒ³ Use the interactive Tree Finder tool below to identify tree species your area. Entering the latitude and longitude of your location, or click on the map the populate the latitude and longitude before clicking "Find Trees". You can also zoom to a zip code to find then click the map to find trees in that area. Note: This is only for North America

The output is a list of all the the "tree" species with ranges that are
likely to overlap with that point.

I'd love to hear your feedback. Let me if this is useful for you and how it could be improved!
