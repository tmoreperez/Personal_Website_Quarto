#### About this website and me...

Hello, and welcome to my website. This site is meant to be repository of my academic research, the open-source tools that I've developed to facilitate various analyses, and tutorials that others might find useful. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

I am a climate change ecologist and an expert in understanding how plants are responding to climate change. I'm fascinated with plant physiology, biogeography, and how these subjects can be used to develop nature-based climate solutions that will be resilient to climate change.

I have a BSc in plant biology from the University of Vermont, a PhD in biology from the University of Miami, and held the prestigious Killam Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of British Columbia. My academic research focuses on how climate change interacts with plant physiology to influence growth, carbon sequestration and species distributions. From 2017-2023 I helped author 16 peer-reviewed scientific publications on climate change and plant ecology in leading journals including Science, PNAS, and Nature Climate Change.

While I love academic research, I joined the private sector in 2022 in order to have a more direct impact on mitigating climate change. Since doing so, I have developed analytical pipelines and carbon reporting tools as part of a team at Conservation International investigating how to scale natural climate solutions. I am currently the Lead Carbon Scientist at [Living Carbon](https://www.livingcarbon.com) where I am part of a team developing nature-based climate change mitigation projects with the first trees ever engineered to enhance photosynthesis and increase carbon sequestration.
